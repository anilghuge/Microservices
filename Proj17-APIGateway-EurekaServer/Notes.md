![Cloud API Gateway](CloudAPIGateWay.png)

**Spring Cloud Gateway** is a framework designed to provide a simple, yet powerful way to route and filter requests in a microservices architecture. It is part of the Spring Cloud ecosystem, which is used for building distributed systems in a cloud-native environment.

### Key Features of Spring Cloud Gateway:

1. **API Gateway:**
   Spring Cloud Gateway acts as an API gateway, which means it handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and forwards them to the appropriate backend service. It serves as a single entry point to the system, improving security, monitoring, and routing.

2. **Routing:**
   It allows flexible and dynamic routing to microservices based on various factors such as URL, HTTP methods, headers, etc. Routes can be configured using Spring Boot configuration files or programmatically.

3. **Filters:**
   Spring Cloud Gateway supports the use of filters, which are functions that allow you to modify the request and response as they pass through the gateway. Filters can be used for purposes like authentication, logging, rate limiting, rewriting URLs, etc.

4. **Load Balancing:**
   The gateway can integrate with **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer** to distribute traffic across multiple instances of services, improving scalability and availability.

5. **Circuit Breaker Support:**
   Spring Cloud Gateway integrates with **Resilience4J** or **Hystrix** for implementing circuit breakers, which helps to gracefully handle failures in backend services and prevent cascading failures in the system.

6. **Security:**
   It provides easy integration with Spring Security for features like authentication and authorization, protecting the backend services from unauthorized access.

7. **Path Matching and Predicate-based Routing:**
   Routes can be defined based on simple predicates (conditions) such as path, host, query parameters, etc. This allows dynamic, flexible routing based on incoming request data.

8. **Rate Limiting:**
   It allows rate-limiting of requests, which is useful to prevent overloading backend services or APIs.

9. **WebSocket and Server-Sent Events (SSE) Support:**
   Spring Cloud Gateway also supports WebSocket and Server-Sent Events (SSE) to handle real-time communication scenarios.

### Basic Components of Spring Cloud Gateway:

- **Routes:** These define how incoming HTTP requests are routed to the backend services. Routes can be mapped to predicates such as path, query parameters, and headers.
  
- **Filters:** Filters are applied to requests before they are forwarded to the backend services. Filters can modify the request, the response, or even block the request. There are pre-filters (executed before forwarding) and post-filters (executed after forwarding).
  
- **Predicates:** Predicates are conditions used to match incoming requests to a specific route. A predicate could be based on URL paths, headers, or query parameters.

### Example Setup:

Here’s an example configuration in `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: service1
          uri: http://localhost:8081
          predicates:
            - Path=/service1/**
          filters:
            - AddRequestHeader=X-Request-Foo, Bar
        - id: service2
          uri: http://localhost:8082
          predicates:
            - Path=/service2/**
```

In this example, requests that match `/service1/**` will be routed to `http://localhost:8081`, and requests that match `/service2/**` will go to `http://localhost:8082`.

### Why Use Spring Cloud Gateway?

1. **Centralized Routing:** Spring Cloud Gateway helps centralize routing logic for microservices, making it easier to manage and maintain.
  
2. **Microservices Integration:** It seamlessly integrates with the Spring Cloud ecosystem, including tools like Spring Cloud Config, Eureka, and Ribbon, for service discovery and configuration management.
  
3. **Scalability:** By using a gateway, you can scale your system more easily, as it handles traffic efficiently, making it possible to grow microservices and user requests in an organized way.

4. **Security and Monitoring:** It provides support for features like SSL, OAuth, JWT authentication, and logging of requests and responses to monitor traffic.




Spring Cloud Gateway is a powerful, reactive API gateway designed for microservices architectures within the Spring ecosystem. Here's a structured breakdown of its key aspects:

### **Core Concepts**
1. **API Gateway Role**: 
   - Acts as a single entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate backend services.
   - Manages cross-cutting concerns like security, monitoring, and resilience.

2. **Reactive Foundation**:
   - Built on **Project Reactor** and **Spring WebFlux**, enabling non-blocking I/O for high scalability and performance.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Routing**:
   - Routes requests to backend services based on **predicates** (conditions like path, headers, or HTTP methods).
   - Integrates with service discovery (e.g., Eureka, Consul) for dynamic routing using service IDs.

2. **Predicates**:
   - Predefined conditions (e.g., `Path`, `Header`, `Cookie`, `Method`, `Query`) to match requests.
   - Example: Route requests with `/api/users/**` to a user service.

3. **Filters**:
   - Modify requests/responses (e.g., add headers, strip URL prefixes, retry failed requests).
   - **Global Filters** (apply to all routes) and **Route-specific Filters**.
   - Examples: `AddRequestHeader`, `RateLimit`, `CircuitBreaker` (via Resilience4J integration).

4. **Load Balancing**:
   - Client-side load balancing using **Spring Cloud LoadBalancer** (replaces Ribbon).

5. **Security**:
   - Supports OAuth2, JWT, and SSL termination.
   - Integrates with Spring Security for authentication/authorization.

6. **Resilience**:
   - Circuit breaking with **Resilience4J** (Hystrix is deprecated).
   - Rate limiting via Redis or in-memory counters.

7. **Monitoring & Tracing**:
   - Metrics with **Micrometer** (Prometheus, Grafana).
   - Distributed tracing with **Sleuth** and **Zipkin**.

### **Configuration**
- **Declarative YAML**: Define routes in `application.yml`.
- **Java DSL**: Programmatic route configuration using a fluent API.
  ```java
  @Bean
  public RouteLocator routes(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
      return builder.routes()
          .route("user_service", r -> r.path("/api/users/**")
              .uri("lb://USER-SERVICE"))
          .build();
  }
  ```

---

### **Use Cases**
1. **Path-Based Routing**:
   - Route `/api/orders/**` to an order service, `/api/products/**` to a product service.
2. **Header-Based Access**:
   - Allow requests only if a specific header (e.g., `X-API-Key`) is present.
3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Restrict abusive clients using token-bucket algorithms.
4. **Canary Deployments**:
   - Route a percentage of traffic to new service versions using weight-based predicates.

---

### **Advantages**
- **Spring Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless with Spring Boot, Cloud, and Security.
- **Reactive Performance**: Efficiently handles high concurrency with minimal threads.
- **Extensibility**: Custom predicates/filters via Spring's dependency injection.

spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      routes:
        - id: user_service
          uri: lb://USER-SERVICE
          predicates:
            - Path=/api/users/**
          filters:
            - StripPrefix=2
            - AddRequestHeader=X-User-Id, 123
```

---

### **Considerations**
- **Reactive Programming**: Requires familiarity with reactive streams (Mono/Flux).
- **Debugging**: Use tools like Actuator endpoints (`/gateway/routes`) for troubleshooting.
- **High Availability**: Deploy multiple gateway instances behind a load balancer.


Certainly! You can configure **Spring Cloud Gateway** both through the `application.properties` (or `application.yml`) file, as well as programmatically through Java code. Below, I'll show you an example of how to define routes and filters programmatically using Java code with the `@Bean` method.

### Example: Configuring Spring Cloud Gateway Using Java Code

Let's go through the steps to configure routes and filters using Java configuration.

#### 1. **Define Routes and Filters Programmatically**

In the example below, we will define routes using the `RouteLocatorBuilder` class in a Java configuration class. The routes are created and configured with filters in this setup.

##### Step 1: Add the necessary dependencies

Make sure your `pom.xml` includes the Spring Cloud Gateway dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Also, include the Spring Boot starter dependency if it’s not already there:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

##### Step 2: Create the Java Configuration Class

In your Spring Boot application, create a Java configuration class that defines routes and filters using the `RouteLocatorBuilder` class.

```java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteLocator;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.builder.RouteLocatorBuilder;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.GatewayFilter;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.factory.AddRequestHeaderGatewayFilterFactory;

@Configuration
public class GatewayConfig {

    @Bean
    public RouteLocator customRouteLocator(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
        return builder.routes()
            // First route: Forwarding to a service based on a path
            .route("route_to_service1", r -> r.path("/service1/**")
                .uri("http://localhost:8081")
                .id("service1"))
            
            // Second route: Forwarding to another service with a filter
            .route("route_to_service2", r -> r.path("/service2/**")
                .uri("http://localhost:8082")
                .filters(f -> f.addRequestHeader("X-Request-Foo", "Bar"))
                .id("service2"))
            
            // Third route with predicate for host-based routing
            .route("route_to_host_based", r -> r.host("*.example.com")
                .uri("http://localhost:8083")
                .id("hostbased"))
            
            // Fourth route with a custom filter (Rate limiting, logging, etc.)
            .route("route_with_filter", r -> r.path("/api/**")
                .filters(f -> f.filter(new CustomLoggingFilter()))
                .uri("http://localhost:8084")
                .id("apigateway"))
            
            .build();
    }

    // Custom filter example
    @Bean
    public GatewayFilter customLoggingFilter() {
        return (exchange, chain) -> {
            System.out.println("Custom Logging Filter: Request to " + exchange.getRequest().getURI());
            return chain.filter(exchange);
        };
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **RouteLocatorBuilder**: The `RouteLocatorBuilder` is used to define routes in a programmatic way. Each route is identified by an ID (like `route_to_service1`, `route_to_service2`).
   
2. **Routing Configuration**: Each `route()` function configures a specific route. The routes are based on:
   - **Path Predicate**: Matching paths like `/service1/**`, `/service2/**`, etc.
   - **URI**: The target destination for the request.
   
3. **Filters**:
   - For example, in the second route, the filter `addRequestHeader()` adds a custom header `X-Request-Foo` to the request before forwarding it to the service.
   - A custom filter (`CustomLoggingFilter`) is also added, which logs the request URI before forwarding it to the service.

4. **Custom Filter**: 
   - A simple filter that logs the request before passing it along in the filter chain is created using the `GatewayFilter` interface.

5. **Host-Based Routing**:
   - The third route uses a host predicate (using `r.host()`) to route requests based on the incoming host header.

### Step 3: Run the Application

Once you have created the configuration class, you can run your Spring Boot application, and it will automatically configure the routes and filters. The routes will behave just like the ones defined in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` files.

### Example of Filtering Requests and Responses

Here’s a more advanced example where we apply filters for both pre- and post-routing logic.

```java
@Bean
public RouteLocator customRouteLocator(RouteLocatorBuilder builder) {
    return builder.routes()
        .route("route_to_service_with_filter", r -> r.path("/custom/**")
            .filters(f -> f.addRequestHeader("X-Custom-Header", "HeaderValue")
                          .filter(new CustomLoggingFilter()))  // Custom filter added
            .uri("http://localhost:8085")
            .id("serviceWithCustomFilter"))
        .build();
}

@Bean
public GatewayFilter customLoggingFilter() {
    return (exchange, chain) -> {
        // Pre-filter logic
        System.out.println("Pre-filter: Request URI " + exchange.getRequest().getURI());

        return chain.filter(exchange).then(Mono.fromRunnable(() -> {
            // Post-filter logic
            System.out.println("Post-filter: Response Status " + exchange.getResponse().getStatusCode());
        }));
    };
}
```

### Summary of Key Points:
- **Programmatic Configuration**: You can define routes, predicates, and filters using Java code with `RouteLocatorBuilder`.
- **Custom Filters**: Filters can modify the request or response, and they can be applied at different stages (pre- or post-routing).
- **Dynamic Routing**: Java configuration gives you the flexibility to define complex routing logic, using path, headers, or even custom predicates.

This approach gives you full control over routing and filtering logic, while also keeping the configuration in Java rather than relying solely on the `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
